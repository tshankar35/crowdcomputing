A Basic Python Program that Demonstrates Crowd Computing
# Crowd Computing

### Crowd Computing is a concept that says that when a data collected from crowd is compiled together and is compared to the actual data it is found that the crowd data is actually very close to actual data. 


In Python We Will Estimate Number of Candies a Jar has on the basis of data given by the crowd of 75, and compare it to actual count of 350

We Will Use Concept of 10% Trimmed Mean to achieve this result, where we remove 10% highest and lowest values from the list of data and then find its mean.
